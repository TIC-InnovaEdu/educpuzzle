=head2 Other methods defined in Encode::Encodings

You do not have to override methods shown below unless you have to.

=over 4

=item -E<gt>name

Predefined As:

  sub name  { return shift->{'Name'} }

MUST return the string representing the canonical name of the encoding.

=item -E<gt>mime_name

Predefined As:

  sub mime_name{
    return Encode::MIME::Name::get_mime_name(shift->name);
  }

MUST return the string representing the IANA charset name of the encoding.

=item -E<gt>renew

Predefined As:

  sub renew {
    my $self = shift;
    my $clone = bless { %$self } => ref($self);
    $clone->{renewed}++;
    return $clone;
  }

This method reconstructs the encoding object if necessary.  If you need
to store the state during encoding, this is where you clone your object.

PerlIO ALWAYS calls this method to make sure it has its own private
encoding object.

=item -E<gt>renewed

Predefined As:

  sub renewed { $_[0]->{renewed} || 0 }

Tells whether the object is renewed (and how many times).  Some
modules emit C<Use of uninitialized value in null operation> warning
unless the value is numeric so return 0 for fals
